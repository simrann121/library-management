2. **Create Database**
   ```bash
   # Connect to PostgreSQL
   sudo -u postgres psql
   
   # Create database
   CREATE DATABASE vidyalankar_library;
   CREATE USER vidyalankar_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE vidyalankar_library TO vidyalankar_user;
   \q
   ```

3. **Run Schema & Sample Data**
   ```bash
   # Run schema
   psql -U vidyalankar_user -d vidyalankar_library -f database/schema.sql
   
   # Insert sample data
   psql -U vidyalankar_user -d vidyalankar_library -f database/sample_data.sql
   ```

### Step 2: Flutter Setup

1. **Install Flutter**
   ```bash
   # Download Flutter SDK

   # Add to PATH
   export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
   
   # Verify installation
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd library-management/vidyalankar-app
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run Code Generation**
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

1. **Create Environment File**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   touch .env
   ```

2. **Add Configuration**
   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://vidyalankar_user:your_password@localhost:5432/vidyalankar_library
   
   # API Configuration
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
   
   # Firebase Configuration (for notifications)
